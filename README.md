# F1Site
This is my personal HTML/Python project for creating a F1-esque site using the OpenF1 API
The Python scripts are created and working on Python 3.13.9
The Site currently has a HomePage, DriversPage, TeamsPage, and a non-functional Schedule page.
Home Page - simple image with some floating items
Drivers Page - gives Name, Driver Number, Team name, and current points in the world championship
Teams Page - Team Name, Logo, and current points in Constructors Championship
Schedule - Work in Progress (not sure what i want from this page yet, focused on school)
